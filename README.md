# NatesPortfolio

This is my portfolio, its mainly trying to showcase c++ programming abilities and an understanding of the UE4 game engine. 
Critique is welcome.


AWorthyItem : contains most of the basic logic to equip, drop, and have stats on the character modified by whatever item is equipped.

AWorhtyWeapon: A weapon system that was designed to have as few variables as possible but allow for many different weapons to be created from its base. Charging weapons are the only type not currently supported. 

AGeneticAlgorithm : A templated GA for mutating whatever you fancy, in this case the example project mutates(or will mutate) every aspect of the game as it progresses. Having the rules, stats, weapons, and AI players change as the game goes on. 

ANeuralNetwork: a basic neural network that the genetic algorithm mutates. Testing with this for replacing a default behavior tree is also a priority
